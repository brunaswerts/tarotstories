                        <p>It was a cold day, and he couldn’t remember if it was either dawn or dusk. He could see the thin, crescent moon though – as if it was there only to compliment her own inner light, the light of her silver crown, the light from her glowing, nearly fluorescent blue robes, darkened only by her black and long hair. </p>
                        <p>She had a book in her hands. He was intrigued. They talked and laughed and remembered and cried – or was it him only? He couldn’t tell. Back then it appeared to be a connection, an exchange, but then it struck him: she never displayed much sign of emotion. It was if as her robes worked as a mysterious veil that constantly clouded her from the world, only allowing here and there the slightest display of affection.</p>

                        <p>She wore a crown. She was beautiful and majestic and for that alone he placed her in a pedestal, surrounded by large pillars – one of the shadows, the past she never shared with them, her mysteries; and one of light, the intellectual and emotional enlightenment she had brought upon him and the thought, the hope of having a life with her. He wanted her all for himself. He didn’t want her to go about and share her knowledge, her passion, her – albeit contained – emotions.</p>
                        <p>- Will you show me something that nobody else has seen?</p>
                        <p>She looked at him with lifeless eyes.</p>

                <p>He began to lose her, then and there. She wasn’t one to be bound by makeshift pillars and a pedestal, let alone his greed and jealousy. Much like the moon, she reflected the light of those that projected themselves unto her. His inner light, however, was becoming dim and he could see it in her eyes. He wondered if anyone had ever managed to penetrate her veil of emotions before she disappeared amidst the waters. Probably not – the lady, as the moon, reflected light, and people were constantly terrified of their own power, their own reflection.</p>
