                <p>The two proceeded to tell their friend - who had just arrived at the village - all about it. Everyone was gathered by the walls, celebrating the end of winter and upcoming spring. A gazebo had been built in front of the gates with four large pillars of ash, oak, birch and yew wood. Flowers could be seen everywhere: decorating the gazebo, the houses, the streets, and even the maidens’ heads, arranged in garlands and crowns.</p></div>

                        <p>Many voices could be heard singing the ancient songs, long past their woodland days – they might live in a modern village now, but they never forgot the old days and the customs they learned from the old people.</p>
                         <p>The last one of those folk that they had heard of was sent to exile in a cave, due to his tail – or was it horns? For a while, people had nothing to celebrate and no joyful date to look forward to, until the following year when someone remembered the marvelous spring parties that the Horned One used to throw.</p>

                <p>They couldn’t tell. It was such an ancient, nearly forgotten story, covered up by those who decided someone must be in charge of people's worship.</p>
                <p>So the wheel of the seasons turned once more and people missed those good days. It all started with a large meal and some music.</p>
                <p>The next year the girls rehearsed a choreography. During the following ones, more people heard of it and came to join them.</p>

                <p>Now the group celebrations were so large that the village's high walls barely contained them, serving merely to block their view of the woodland, the flowers, the Moon and the Sun.</p>
                <p>But something from within still drove them out of their houses down those shady groves that surrounded the village walls, so they could summon the shadows of their glorious past with the upcoming return of springtime.</p>
